# Portfolio Site

This project uses Gatsby with Tailwind CSS. Image assets were removed to keep the repository lightweight.

## Missing images
The site references images for the hero background, profile picture, and project cards. By default, placeholder URLs are used. To personalize the site, generate your own images and place them in `src/images`, updating the components accordingly.

### Suggested ChatGPT prompts
1. **Hero background**
   > Generate a high-resolution abstract background suitable for the hero section of a developer portfolio website.
2. **Profile picture**
   > Create a professional avatar of a software architect.
3. **Microservices project**
   > Produce a simple diagram representing a microservices architecture.
4. **Workflow migration project**
   > Illustrate a web dashboard that demonstrates workflow migration.
5. **Modernization project**
   > Create an image symbolizing modernization of legacy systems.

Use ChatGPT with the DALLÂ·E model to create PNG files for each prompt. Save them with these filenames:

- `hero-bg.png`
- `profile.png`
- `microservices.png`
- `workflow.png`
- `modernization.png`

Place them in `src/images/` and replace the placeholder URLs in the components if desired.
