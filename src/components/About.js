          With over 9 years of industry experience, I specialize in delivering scalable,
          secure, and high-performance enterprise applications. As a Technical Solutions
          Architect, I lead teams through complex transformations â€” from monolith to
          microservices, legacy to cloud-native. I thrive on building value-driven,
          modern platforms for the financial and retirement sectors.
